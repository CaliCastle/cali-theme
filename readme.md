## Cali's PHPStorm Theme

Hi there, I'm Cali and I love developing with a beautiful color theme in my editor, nice and clean like the way I wanted it to be.

Anyways, if you like this theme, give me a star, thanks~!

## Installation
Simply copy `cali-theme.icls` to:

    ~/Library/Preferences/WebIde100/colors
    
For windows: copy the file under the following path:

    %USERPROFILE%\.WebIde100\config\colors
